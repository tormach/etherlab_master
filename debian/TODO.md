EtherLab EtherCAT master, Tormach PathPilot edition

Debian Packaging ToDo:

*   libethercat1 package contains the libethercat.so
    and libethercat.so.1 symlinks to libethercat.so.1.1.0.
    These are development files and should be part
    of libethercat1-dev package
*   Some older sourcefiles are not in a UTF-8 encoding,
    investigation if this is the right state should
    be carried out
*   No executables currently have a manual page
*   Packages have no copyright file
