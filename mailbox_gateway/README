1) General Information
======================

Provides an EtherCAT Mailbox Gateway (MBG) server for the IgH EtherCAT Master.

The Mailbox Gateway server provides access for external or remote applications
to communicate with EtherCAT slave mailboxes.  Based on the specification at:
https://www.ethercat.org/memberarea/download/ETG8200_V1i0i0_G_R_MailboxGateway.pdf

The server provides for UDP and up to 16 TCP connections.  The connections
are not multi-threaded.

The server can be used with tools such as:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2) Building
===========

Building of the MBG server is controlled by the --enable-mbg configuration
flag.  Building the MBG server is enabled by default, but can be disabled by
setting the flag to false.  e.g.:

  --enable-mbg=no

The application is named ethercat_mbg and is installed into /usr/bin/

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3) Running
==========

ethercat_mbg can be run directly from the command line as either a foreground
or background process.  If you have more than one master running you will
need to select which master the server is providing a gateway for.

As the EtherCAT Mailbox Gateway server port is defined as 34980 (0x88A4) only
one instance of the server may be running at a time.

The server will pass on any EtherCAT mailbox communication request regardless
of protocol type.  However if an invalid request is made or any errors occur
there will be no response from the server.  If no response occurs check the
ethercat_mbg output logs and the ethercat master logs.

ethercat_mbg outputs log information to stdout.  This can be redirected to a
log file.  If an internal application error occurs and the application is
halted the log entry will be output to stderr.

WARNING: The EtherCAT Mailbox Gateway does not provide any security.  It will
provide direct mailbox access to any slave on the master.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4) Testing
==========

Testing of the gateway can be performed using the netcat utility.  netcat can
connect to the MBG by either UDP or TCP.  As such you only need to provide
the mailbox header and data.

e.g.:

  echo '10500A000400000300204018100100000000' | xxd -r -p | netcat -w 1 -u 192.168.0.1 34980 | xxd -p

Where:

        +---------------------- EtherCAT Header
        |                         length: 16
        |                         data type: 0x05 (mailbox)
        |   +------------------ Mailbox Header
        |   |                     length: 10
        |   |                     slave address: 4
        |   |                     type: 0x03 (CoE)
        |   |           +------ CoE Header
        |   |           |         service: 2 (SDO request)
        |   |           |   +-- SDO:
        |   |           |   |     command specifier: 0x02 (upload request)
        |   |           |   |     index: 0x1018
        |   |           |   |     subindex: 0x01
        |   |           |   |
  echo '10500A000400000300204018100100000000'
  
      echo provides the raw packet information in hexidecimal
  
  xxd -r -p
  
      xxd, convert hex to binary
          -r  (reverse) converts hex to binary
          -p  reads plain (continuous) hex

  netcat -w 1 -u 192.168.0.1 34980
  
      netcat, arbitrary TCP and UDP connections and listens
          -w 1         wait 1 second for replies before exiting
          -u           UDP connection
          192.168.0.1  IP address of ethercat_mbg server
          34980        MBG server port number
          
      netcat sends the binary information to the MBG server and listens
      for a reply.
      Note: remove the -u parameter to make a TCP connection

  xxd -p
  
      xxd, convert the response binary to hex
          -p  outputs plain (continuous) hex

The above packet is a request for a slaves Vendor ID (CoE item 0x1018:01).
For a beckhoff module this responds with the following information:

  10500a000400002300304318100102000000
  
The last 4 bytes is the response payload in little endian.  So the slave
has responded with a VendorID of 0x00000002.

Note:
  The Mailbox Header has a Cnt parameter (bits 5-7 of the last byte 
  of the header).  If this value is zero the slave should always
  accept the incoming mailbox request.  If the value is non-zero (1-7)
  then the slave will only accept the request if the value is different
  to the previous mailbox request Cnt value.
